__ðŸ“˜ What is a Queue?__

ðŸ‘‰ A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
The first element inserted is the first one to be removed.

__Example:__ Think of people standing in a line at a ticket counter:  

Person enters at the rear â†’ Enqueue  

Person leaves from the front â†’ Dequeue

__ðŸ”¹ Key Features of Queue__

__Order:__ Follows FIFO.

__Access:__ Only front and rear elements are accessible.

__Insertion:__ Done at the rear.

__Deletion:__ Done at the front.

__ðŸ”¹ Queue Operations__

__Enqueue:__ Insert an element at the rear of the queue.

__Dequeue:__ Remove an element from the front of the queue.

__Front/Peek:__ Get the element at the front without removing it.

__isEmpty:__ Check if the queue is empty.

__isFull:__ Check if the queue is full (in case of array implementation).

__ðŸ‘‰ Types of Queues:__

__1.Simple Queue:__ Basic FIFO structure.

__2.Circular Queue:__ Last position is connected back to the first (efficient memory use).

__3.Priority Queue:__ Elements are dequeued based on priority, not arrival time.

__4.Double-Ended Queue (Deque):__ Insertion and deletion possible at both ends.
