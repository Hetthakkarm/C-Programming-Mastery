ðŸ“˜ __What is a Stack?__
ðŸ‘‰ A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
The last element inserted is the first one to be removed.

Example: Think of a stack of plates in a cafeteria:

You put a plate on top â†’ Push
You remove a plate from top â†’ Pop

ðŸ”¹ Key Features of Stack
Order: Follows LIFO.
Access: Only top element is accessible.
Insertion/Deletion: Done only at the top.

ðŸ”¹ Stack Operations

Push: Insert an element at the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove the element from the top of the stack.
Peek/Top: Get the element at the top without removing it.
isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
isFull: Check if the stack is full (in case of array implementation).
