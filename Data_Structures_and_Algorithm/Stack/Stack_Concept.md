ðŸ“˜ __What is a Stack?__
ðŸ‘‰ A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
The last element inserted is the first one to be removed.

__Example:__ Think of a stack of plates in a cafeteria:

You put a plate on top â†’ Push
You remove a plate from top â†’ Pop

ðŸ”¹ __Key Features of Stack__
__Order:__ Follows LIFO.  

__Access:__ Only top element is accessible.  

__Insertion/Deletion:__ Done only at the top.   


ðŸ”¹ Stack Operations

__Push:__ Insert an element at the top of the stack.  

__Pop:__ Remove the element from the top of the stack.   

__Peek/Top:__ Get the element at the top without removing it.   

__isEmpty:__ Check if the stack is empty.  

__isFull:__ Check if the stack is full (in case of array implementation).
