ðŸ‘‰ A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.

The last element inserted is the first one to be removed.

Think of a stack of plates in a cafeteria:

- You put a plate on top â†’ Push
- You remove a plate from top â†’ Pop

ðŸ”¹ Key Features of Stack
- Order: Follows LIFO.
- Access: Only top element is accessible.
- Insertion/Deletion: Done only at the top.

ðŸ”¹ Stack Operations
- Push: Add an element to the stack.
- Pop: Remove an element from the stack.
- Peek/Top: View the top element without removing it.
- Display: Show all elements of the stack (top to bottom).
